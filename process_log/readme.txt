This project was part of a course on operating systems that involved creating custom system calls. These calls were created and implemented on ReptilianOS, which is modeled after Android and Ubuntu systems (https://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/reptilian/wiki/doku.php). The diff file shows the changes Reptilian's installation files and the changes made to create the custom system calls, and the tarball contains a basic library code wrapper for these system calls.
